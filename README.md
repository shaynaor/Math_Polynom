Version:0.1
This code can receive a monomial or a polynomial , ax^b when a is a real number and b is a positive integer (natural)number , and can perform basic task : add, multiply and subtract. And more complex tasks such as: finding root of a polynomial between two points , and finding the area of a polynomial using Riemann Integral between two points.
Notes:
⦁ Creating a new Monom and not giving it any values will set it to 0. 
⦁ Creating a new Polynom and not giving it any values will leave it empty.
If you do the basic tasks on the empty polynom it will simply add the other polynom to the empty one.
Issues:
Current version has No input checks and we assume the input is correct if not the program will crash.
Constructing new monom with string : The string must be written as such :"ax^b"
When a is a real number and b is a positive integer (natural)number.
a can be positive or negative , b must be positive.
Constructing a new Polynom wit string: The string must be written as such:"ax^b+a1x^b1..."
No spaces are allowed, and the "+" can be a "-".
